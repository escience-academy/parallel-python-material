    "Noodles is there to make your life easier, *in parallel*! The reason why Noodles can be easy and do parallel Python at the same time is its *functional* approach. In one part you'll define a set of functions that you'd like to run with Noodles, in an other part you'll compose these functions into a *workflow graph*. To make this approach work a function should not have any *side effects*. Let's not linger and just start noodling! First we define some functions to use."
