Argh, this tutorial was supposed to be on flow control! We move on to the sequential version. Wait, I hear you think, we were using Noodles to do things in parallel!?? Why make an effort to do sequential work? Well, we'll need it to implement the divide-and-conquer strategy, among other things. Noodles is not only a framework for parallel programming, but it also works concurrent. In the context of a larger workflow we may still want to make decision steps on a sequential basis, while another component of the workflow is happily churning out numbers."
