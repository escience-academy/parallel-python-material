Material for parallel python workshop

## Program

1. Python concurrency primitives:
    - threads
    - processes
    - the GIL
    - ways around the GIL: C++/Cython
    - when the GIL is good: multi-IO
2. Async IO:
    - generators: yield
    - coroutines: yield
    - async/await (yield again)
    - run-times for asyncio
3. Functional programming in Python:
    - generating the Fibonacci sequence
    - higher order functions
    - decorators
    - recursion
    - pattern matching
4. Dask
5. Noodles
6. Applications

## Setup
Use a virtual environment and install the prerequisites:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the notebooks:
